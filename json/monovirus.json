   "about":"MonoVirus was a project that I worked on with three other engineers â€“ Zach Vega-Perkins, Mathew Schacher, and Cherys Fair. Together we wanted to create a dungeon crawler with a bit of a darker twist, much like games like Pandemic.\n\nTo do this, we created a procedurally generated dungeon that gave the appearance of blood vessels, and crafted our player character and our enemy characters as if they were a virus and human cells (respectively).",
   "lookBack":"Since the team was composed entirely of engineers, I ended up doing a great deal of design work over the course of the project. I created all of the UI elements in the game, using primarily GIMP, and also created all of the 3D models for the various characters in the game.\n\nDespite that, I still found plenty of time to work with the code, which was a great learning experience for me, as it was my first time working with C#, MonoGame, and XNA.",
